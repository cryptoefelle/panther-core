                                that is subject to intellectual property rights,
                                in which case we retain all rights to such

                                <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. These Terms
                                constitute the entire and exclusive
                                understanding and agreement between Panther and
                                you regarding the Interface, and these Terms
                                supersede and replace all prior oral or written
                                understandings or agreements between Panther and
                                you regarding the Interface. If any provision of
                                these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by
                                an arbitrator or a court of competent
                                jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to
                                the maximum extent permissible and the other
                                provisions of these Terms will remain in full
                                force and effect. Except where provided by
                                Applicable Law in your jurisdiction, you may not
                                assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of
                                law or otherwise, without Panther's prior
                                written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
                                transfer these Terms absent our consent, or your
                                statutory right, will be null. Panther may
                                freely assign or transfer these Terms without
                                restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these
                                Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the
                                parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

                                failure to enforce any right or provision of
                                these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                                such right or provision. The waiver of any such
                                right or provision will be effective only if in
                                writing and signed by a duly authorized
                                representative of Panther. Except as expressly
                                set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
                                party of any of its remedies under these Terms
